# SQL Table Custom Element

A custom html element that allows executing arbitrary SQL on an SQLite database in the browser.
Demo viewable online [here](https://iciaran.github.io/html-sql-table/).

Please do not use this, it's a really awful idea that I threw together as a joke after a friend suggested that html should be able to directly interact with a database.
I take no responsibility for anything that happens if you choose to ignore this warning.

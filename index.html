          <pre><strong>Please do not use this</strong>, it's a really awful idea that I threw together as a joke after a friend suggested that html should be able to directly interact with a database.
I take no responsibility for anything that happens if you choose to ignore this warning.</pre>

        <h2>So what is this?</h2>
        <p>
          Inspired by a discord conversation that started a little like this:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Just started wondering if there is a way to read from a database in
            HTML ðŸ¤”
          </p>
          <cite>- gusgo99</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>and quickly led to:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&lt;sql query=&quot;SELECT * FROM Foo&quot; /&gt;</p>
          <cite>- moon_president</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          This is a collection of custom HTML elements that allow running
          arbitrary sql queries on an SQLite database fetched from the server.
          From a practical point of view this is entirely useless and should
          never be used, but it was a fun introduction to web components and I
          did learn a couple of things along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          The code can be browsed on Github
          <a
            href="https://github.com/iCiaran/html-sql-table/blob/main/sql-element.js"
            >here</a
          >, or just open your browser's dev tools and take a look at the source
          for the examples below.

        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          This is a haphazard implementation of an idea that should have
          remained just that, it is not remotely production ready (and never
          will be). I could list limitations all day, here are the first few
          that come to mind:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Security</strong> What security? The entire SQLite database
            is sent to the front-end, nothing is private.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Performance</strong> No effort has been made to make this
            performant, the UI thread is used even though SQLite explicitly
            discourages this (use a worker thread instead for long running
            JavaScript operations), if multiple tables use the same database
            file it's loaded each time, the list goes on...
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Compatibility</strong> Only SQLite, I did look to see if any
            browser -> database clients existed (even more horrifying), but the
            (lack of) raw TCP socket support in browsers currently makes those
            not possible.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Error handling</strong> There is none!</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Custom element callbacks</strong> Only
            <code>connectedCallback</code> has been implemented, any time the
            position of these elements in the DOM is manipulated weird things
            might happen.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>More</strong> Likely many more, I really wasn't kidding in
            the warning at the top of this page, don't use this!
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Examples</h2>
        A few examples of the elements in action, the SQLite database used can
        be downloaded <a href="pets.db" download>here</a> to browse in a more
        sane way.
        <h3>Single value selection</h3>
        <p>
          Single values can be selected from the database using the
          <code>&lt;sql-value&gt;</code> element.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a single value the field returned <strong>must</strong> be named
          <code>value</code> in the SQL statement.
        </p>
        <p>
          If multiple rows are returned then the value from the first row is
          used.
        </p>
        <pre class="example-placeholder"></pre>
        <p>
          The pet with the name 'Rex' is a
          <sql-value
            database="pets.db"
            query="select type value from pets where name='Rex'"
          ></sql-value>
          .
        </p>
        <h3>Simple select all</h3>
        <p>List of users with their IDs, names, and ages.</p>
        <pre class="example-placeholder"></pre>
        <sql-table database="pets.db" query="select * from users"></sql-table>

        <h3>Choosing specific columns and filtering</h3>
        <p>Table headings will reflect the column names used in the query.</p>
        <pre class="example-placeholder"></pre>
        <sql-table
          database="pets.db"
          query="select name, type as animal from pets where owner = 1"
        ></sql-table>

        <h3>Joins e.t.c.</h3>
        <p>
          More advanced queries are possible, even modifications though they
          won't be persisted and each table has it's own instance of the
          database so they're very pointless.
        </p>
        <pre class="example-placeholder"></pre>
        <sql-table
          database="pets.db"
          query="select distinct u.name, count(1) as 'pet count' from pets p join users u on p.owner = u.id group by p.owner"
        ></sql-table>

        <h3>Empty results</h3>
        <p>
          Well, what did you expect? If there are no results from the query the
          table will still be displayed, it just won't have any rows.
        </p>
        <pre class="example-placeholder"></pre>
        <sql-table
          database="pets.db"
          query="select * from pets where owner = 1000"
        ></sql-table>

        <h3>Syntax Errors</h3>
        <p>
          Did I mention there's no error handling? If the database file doesn't
          exist or the query has invalid syntax things get a bit messy...
        </p>
        <pre class="example-placeholder"></pre>
        <sql-table database="pets.db" query="select ???"></sql-table>
